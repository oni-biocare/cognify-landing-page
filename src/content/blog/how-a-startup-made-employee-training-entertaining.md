# How a Startup Made Employee Training Entertaining

WorkRamp’s journey began with a narrow focus: **helping sales teams become more efficient**. As early customers achieved success, they quickly asked for more—training for support reps, partners, and even end-users. That feedback guided WorkRamp toward a much larger vision: **an enterprise learning platform that any team can rely on for every learning need**.

## From Point Solution to Platform

San-Francisco-based WorkRamp entered the market at a time when **corporate learning was badly underserved**. CEO **Ted Blosser** recognized the gap and set out to build software that modern teams would actually enjoy using. The platform’s turning point came in 2016 with the acquisition of Y-Combinator-backed **Prelude**. That deal introduced a GitHub-like authoring system that lets companies create and share their own training content—laying the foundation for today’s all-in-one solution.

## Empowering People, Wherever They Work

Whether employees are **on-site, remote, or in the field**, WorkRamp’s goal is the same: equip them to excel in their roles so they can deliver greater value to customers and the business. Household names such as **Airbnb, Slack, Uber, and Zoom** adopted the platform even before WorkRamp’s Series A, validating both the product and the market need.

To date, the startup has raised **$27.2 million**, including a **$17 million Series B** in December 2020—capital that is fueling product expansion and customer growth.

## Making Learning Fun (Yes, Really)

Traditional learning tech often feels like a chore—think mandatory compliance videos that everyone dreads. WorkRamp attacked that stigma head-on by **designing an engaging learner experience**:

- **Bite-sized lessons** that respect attention spans
- **Interactive modules** that keep users involved
- **Gamified elements** that reward progress

The result? Employees are genuinely excited to log in, learn, and get better at their jobs.

## The Hardest Part Isn’t Product–Market Fit

Blosser admits that he once believed finding product–market fit would be the toughest hurdle. Instead, he discovered a greater challenge: **building a mission-aligned team committed to a bold, long-term vision**. Crafting a strong culture now consumes much of the leadership’s focus, ensuring that the company scales its people as effectively as it scales its platform.

## Looking Ahead

WorkRamp’s story proves that when learning is **effective, engaging, and accessible**, it becomes a strategic driver of business success rather than a box-checking exercise. By prioritizing user experience and company culture, the startup is redefining what corporate training can—and should—be.
